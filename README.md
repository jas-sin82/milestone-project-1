## Error found during site development 

   * During the site development I found the error in nutrition.html ( webpage had horigental space) even I used margin 0 padding 0 in external css to
    removes all default margin and padding for every object on the page but it did not helped. 

   ![screenshot](mock-images/bug-image.png)

   *  To remove this space I decided to test internal css To fix this error, I used internal css body,html { margin= 0, padding = 0, width:100% ,height: 100%,                  overflow-x:hidden} After when I inculde this line of code error was resolved. 

   * I found  bug in footer section of form-submition.html.When I was working on this page what I saw footer occupied the half of space of whole page, to remove this bug 
     I used height = auto which removed all this space and footer get back to the bottom of the page.
